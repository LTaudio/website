## Services

We create every kind of audio plug-ins in VST, AU and AAX for your private or commercial use! As developers in a Berlin based plug-in manufacture, we have the 
experience in working out great ideas and turning them into a flawless audio plugin. Regarding a graphical user interface, we are experienced in working with 
designs from third-party designers, but we are also happy to introduce you to designers from our environment, to do the graphical art for you.
As a little icing on the cake, we can offer many different extras, such as a licensing system to protect your audio plugin from getting illegally copied. Answers to all kind of questions can be either found in our FAQ (link) or be answered after a small introduction of yourself and your project to [contact@ltaudio.de](mailto:contact@ltaudio.de).



## Technical Stuff

We have satisfactorily completed many projects with different people, all having different technical knowledge, we had to deal with. In that time we have developed a workflow that makes it easy for you to work with us and gives us the confidence to handle all your requirements. We would like to explain this briefly here, so that we can all look forward to smooth cooperation later on:

**1: The description of your project:**

Depending on the status of your project, we are happy to help you with a creative brainstorming session to finalize any unresolved sections. However, we need clear instructions in order to work, which means that you should already have an idea of how and if your idea is technically feasible. 

**2: The user interface:**

If you or a designer you know created the graphical user interface, we need these files. Our framework can handle SVG and PNG file formats and unfortunately nothing else. Each component, i.e. each button, knob or small screen must be available as a single file. These must be cut exactly so that the elements file is the exact size of its content and no unnecessary border must be cut off. In addition, for rotating elements such as rotary sliders, care must be taken to ensure that the point around which it is to rotate is centrally located in the middle of the component.


## About us:

**Tobias Hienzsch**


**Lukas KÃ¤hler**

I graduated from the University of popular Arts in Berlin in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in Audio Design and have become professional in programming audio applications in C++ over the last few years. I'm a free DSP developer for the Berlin based plugin manufacture Modern Circuits and have collaborated with them for some projects, which will be released in January 2022.
Through my work in Berlin and especially this company, I am now very well connected and know the right answers for all important questions, or at least the people who know the answers.

## FAQ:

**How long will this take?**

Developing a plug-in can be done within 2 weeks or half a year. That depends on your requirements and wishes for graphical design and audio code, and whether this is technically easy to realize, what we often cannot predict exactly in advance.


**How much will this cost?**

Of course, this is just as difficult to estimate as the time we would need for your project. Sometimes the implementation of a simple idea is technically more difficult than that of a complex idea with technically simple solutions. So we can only give an indication when we fully know and understand your idea. Usually, the price range of 1 - 3 thousand euros is not exceeded.


**Can I distribute/sell the software you developed for me?**

Yes! You will receive the full source code, binary executable and installers for this project, which means you can sell and modify it at any time. You 
need to register with Steinberg to sell a VST3 version of your plugin. Same applies for Avid and the AAX format.


**Do you support Pro Tools (AAX)?**

It is complicated. If you want to publish your plugin for the Avid ecosystem, you as the vendor need to register with the Avid Developer program. This is not 
something that we can legally do for you. Only after you have done this step, we are allowed to send you test versions in AAX format. Our framework has permanent AAX support, so you can always choose to buy an AAX license later, when your plug-in is already working or even on the market.


**What about a copy-protection system?**

We can make a licensing system against illegal copying for everything you want. We can either create one for online or offline registration, depending on whether you are already running an internet server, the plug-ins can connect to or not. Even entire download tools as a separate software app with integrated licensing of all purchased software products are possible. We can also implement a licensing system in plug-ins that come from other developers. For this, we need the source code of the plugin and nothing else.


**Do I need a JUCE license?**

In principle no, you don't need a JUCE licence, because we have one. The exception to this is, if you subsequently make your own changes to the source code we have 
developed for you, since you are then working as a developer yourself.


**Can you "copy" annother Plug-In?**

Generally: no. It is not possible to take an already existing plug-in and have a look into its source code or rewrite it. The only exception is, when it's open source software or you have annother legal acces to the source code and are allowed to use it.
